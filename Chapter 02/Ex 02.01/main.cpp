/*
 *  int, long, long long and short are all integral types.
 *  However, they have various minimum size:
 *      short    : 16bits
 *      int      : 16bits
 *      long     : 32bits
 *      long long: 64bits
 *  Besides, int       will ba at least as short,
 *           long      will be at least as int  ,
 *           long long will be at least as long .

 *  signed types hold a bit to represent the significent.
 *  For example, signed char holds the value from -128 to 127 inclusive,
 *       while unsignde char holds the value from    0 to 255 inclusive.

 *  float  means single-precision floating-point, which holds 32bits and at least  6 significant digits;
 *  double means double-precision floating-point, which holds 64bits and at least 10 significnt digits.
